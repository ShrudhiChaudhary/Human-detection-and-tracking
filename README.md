## Design:

- The project is designed in a way to detect humans and also track them in a live stream.

- The models used for this are Yolov5s (small) and Yolov4 - tiny

- If we prioritize accuracy and are willing to allocate slightly more computational resources, Yolov5s may be the better choice.

- It's likely to provide better detection performance while still being relatively lightweight compared to larger models.

- If real-time performance is of utmost importance and we can accept some trade-offs in detection accuracy, Yolov4 Tiny might be suitable for your use case.

- Hence both models are designed to be lightweight and efficient, but they have different trade-offs in terms of accuracy and performance. 

## Implementation
- Download the required dataset from Collab notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R90bI2HRIchbL8JzwEYkrFCR3Bv-yRtc?usp=sharing
- First, clone the notebook with the Github.
- Implement and run the Collab notebook for Yolov5s - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b4n_uVcSOed3h9qJ3udzEbVC4JiU-s--?usp=sharing
- Implement and run the Collab notebook for Yolov4 - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wwUifoEAxgY2KdoVgIznUMZqxXOpfnCG?usp=sharing
