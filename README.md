# Human-detection-and-tracking
Design:

The project is designed in a way to detect humans and also track them in a live stream.

The models used for this are Yolov5s (small) and Yolov4 - tiny

If we prioritize accuracy and are willing to allocate slightly more computational resources, Yolov5s may be the better choice.

It's likely to provide better detection performance while still being relatively lightweight compared to larger models.

If real-time performance is of utmost importance and we can accept some trade-offs in detection accuracy, Yolov4 Tiny might be suitable for your use case.

Hence both models are designed to be lightweight and efficient, but they have different trade-offs in terms of accuracy and performance.
